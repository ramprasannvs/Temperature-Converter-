# Temperature Converter Website 

## Introduction

Hello, fellow developers! I'm excited to share my latest project: a practical **Temperature Converter**. This project is perfect for those looking to enhance their JavaScript skills by working with user inputs, performing conversions, and dynamically updating the DOM. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this Temperature Converter is a great project to understand the basics of unit conversion.

## Project Overview

The **Temperature Converter** is a web-based application that allows users to easily convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. This project demonstrates how to create an interactive user interface, handle calculations, and provide real-time feedback to the user.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for ease of use.
- **Real-Time Conversion**: Instantly converts temperature values as you input them.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes, providing a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Multiple Unit Support**: Converts between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structures the web page and input elements.
- **CSS**: Styles the interface, ensuring a clean and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the conversion logic and updates the temperature values in real-time.


## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/abhishekboadgurjar/Temperature-Converter.git
    ```

2. **Open the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd Temperature-Converter
    ```

3. **Run the project**:
    - Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to start using the Temperature Converter.

## Usage

1. **Open the website** in a web browser.
2. **Enter a temperature value** in either Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin input fields.
3. **View the converted values** automatically updated in the corresponding fields.
4. **Reset the fields** if you want to start a new conversion.
